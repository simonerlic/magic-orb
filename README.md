# Fortune - The Magic Orb
This is a quick little swift app that emulates the funcitonality of a "Magic 8 Ball". 

The idea is somewhat simple, you ask "the orb" a question, shake your phone, and an answer will appear in front of you.

## Why?

I used this project as a chance to brush up on my Swift skills for another project that is currently in the works. 
It's pretty simple, consisting of 50 yes/no/maybe answers, shake detection, on-device transcription, and text animation (via a package.)

Overall, this was a fun 2-day project to work on during my off time in between clases! This is the closest to a "finished" app that I've created in Swift, so going through the processes (creating the app, icon, submitting to TestFlight, etc.) was quite interesting. Unfortunately, it was rejected as "spam", since they have far too many of this kind of app (which I totally understand haha). So, since I'm not planning on doing much else with this, I decided to open-source it for others to learn off of. 

Again, since this was a 2-day quick project, there are a lot of things that I didn't do correcty- notably:
 - Move shake detection to its own model
 - Get transcription working automatically
 - UI jank
 - Splash screen being gross
 - Terrible "info" section

I also had a few ideas for features, such as:
 - Adding a "share" button to allow people to share the answers
 - Adding "DLC" responses (e.g. a snarky pack, custom packs, etc.)

But overall, I'm somewhat proud of what I made. Have fun with it, and let me know if you want to make any changes!

## How to run

Ideally, you have a Mac with Xcode installed. Simply clone this repository, open it, add yourself for signing (I, in theory, removed my account), and then run on device!

## License

I chose the MIT license, since it allows yall to make whatever you want from it. If you do make something using it as a base let me know what you create!
